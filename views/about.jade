      p Spotmaps is an on-going project to map the colour footprints of different films.
      p Films are processed through a Python/OpenCV pipeline: each frame's colour sampled, and  spot of average colour is produced from the combination of one second's frames.
      p Spots are laid out 60 per line to represent one minute of film time. The length of the image represents the number of minutes in the film.
      p No additional image processing is performed.
      p A 24-colour Adobe swatch file in ASE format and a hex RGB colour file are available to download for each spotmap.
      p This project is based on Brendan Dawes' <a href="http://brendandawes.com/projects/cinemaredux">Cinema Redux</a>.
